TODO FILE (Conversation):

- TextArea:
	- Automatic line wrapping
	- fading of the Text
	- fade every character slowly in
	- audio support
	- support for reading/writing json-files (libjson ?)
	- save/load system
	- make everything resolution independent
		- position = 0 - 100% ?
		- scaling of the objects (need idea)
	
- SpriteEngine
	- more effects:
		- blurring
		
- ImageSequences need a option that every image has its own variables (setcenter...)

- Transitions behave differently in Debug and in release builds
	- debug works correct
	- in the release build the old background doesn't seem to fade out

- advanced conditions
	- when x >= y
	- when x >  y
	- ...
	- maybe with another flag array with float values ?
